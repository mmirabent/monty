# Monty Hall Problem Simulator

I'm intrigued by the [monty hall problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem). So I wrote a progam in C to run through an arbitrary number of monty hall type games to test the game theory.

I'm pretty sure I got the simulation right, because with 100,000,000 trials I consistently get a 66.67% win ratio.
